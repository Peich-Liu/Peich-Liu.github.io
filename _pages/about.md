This page serves as my online CV and portfolio, where you can find all the projects I have worked on over time.

I'm a master student in  Technical University of Denmark(DTU). My primary interests are brain-computer interface (BCI) and embedded system. I also interested in the machine learning algorithms in the bio-signal processing.
